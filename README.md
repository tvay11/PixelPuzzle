- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort

## Warning
- **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm can take between 2-3 minutes to complete the sorting process.
- **Quick Sort**: There is a known issue where Quick Sort may crash on certain configurations due to the nature of the algorithm.


## Features
- Real-time visualization of the sorting process.
- Easy-to-use GUI built with Qt.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- C++ Compiler
- Qt6 

## How To Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Build it with cmake
